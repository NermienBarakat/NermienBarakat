# 👋 Hi, I’m Neri

## 👀 About Me
I’m a **software engineer and student** with a strong interest in building clean, scalable web applications and developing **systems-level thinking** through computer science fundamentals.

I enjoy working on projects that balance **practical product design** with **solid architecture**, and I prefer solutions that are minimal, well-structured, and easy to extend.

## 🎯 Current Focus
- Studying **algorithms, data structures, and computability**
- Building a **file transfer SaaS** focused on large-file workflows
- Working with **modern full-stack web technologies**
- Improving system design and **cloud-native patterns**

---

## 🚀 Projects
- **File Transfer system** — Large file transfer platform  
  *(direct-to-object-storage uploads, signed URLs, scalable architecture)*
- Academic projects focused on **algorithms and complexity analysis**

---

## 📚 Learning Philosophy
I value:
- First-principles understanding
- “Build small, then evolve”
- Documentation that explains *why*, not just *how*

---

## 💞️ Collaboration
I’m interested in collaborating on:
